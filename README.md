# Linear Regression Training Project: Ecommerce Clients

## Overview

In this project, we explore and analyze a dataset from an e-commerce website to help decide whether the company should focus more on improving their mobile app experience or their website. By employing linear regression, we aim to understand the factors influencing customer spending and provide data-driven recommendations.

The dataset used in this project is [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iyadavvaibhav/ecommerce-customer-device-usage/notebooks). It includes the following columns:
- **Avg. Session Length**: Average session length of in-store style advice sessions.
- **Time on App**: Average time spent on the app in minutes.
- **Time on Website**: Average time spent on the website in minutes.
- **Length of Membership**: Number of years the customer has been a member.
- **Yearly Amount Spent**: Amount spent by the customer annually.
